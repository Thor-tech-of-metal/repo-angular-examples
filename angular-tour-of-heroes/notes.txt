* <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes$ | async" >

The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, not an array.

The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable. But there's also a pipe character (|) followed by async, which identifies Angular's AsyncPipe.

The AsyncPipe subscribes to an Observable automatically so you won't have to do so in the component class.

* <input #searchBox id="search-box" (input)="search(searchBox.value)" />

Every time the user types in the textbox, the binding calls search() with the textbox value, a "search term".
The searchTerms becomes an Observable emitting a steady stream of search terms.
